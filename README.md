# Robot-movement
This repository for control movement robot pages. I have used Laravel 8, which is framework php, for back-end pages. There are two version for website control movement. The first one Arabic version and another English version. Inside the two versions there are two folders. First one, it is control-movement folder which has website pages. I prefer to use Visual Studio code for opening the control-movement folder because you need to use terminal and write (php artisan serve) to see the pages write URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)  and there are two pages index and see-settings. The second page you need add in the URL (display). Second one, it is UI folder that contains two pages UI. There is SQL file to download, or you can download by write (php artisan migrate). The pages location are control-movement -> resources -> view. For the assets is control-movement -> public.

Note: you need to change the name of database inside .env file (DB_DATABASE) with your database name and username (DB_USERNAME) and password (DB_PASSWORD) if you have password. Note: if you canâ€™t run (php artisan serve), you should download Composer.
